## Features

* [Nokia 5110 Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/338)
* Joystick+Gyroscopic controls
* Bluetooth controlled

## Quick start

To make car work you just need to flash the [Receiver](codes/Receiver/Receiver.ino) as well as [Transmitter](codes/Transmitter/Transmitter.ino) code into the Arduino. But before all that you need to configure Master and Slave Bluetooth devices by going in there [AT mode](https://www.hackster.io/Heathen_Hacks-v2/hc-05-master-slave-communication-61833f). i had used HC-05 as the Bluetooth communication Device.
